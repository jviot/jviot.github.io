  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Human Endogenous RetroVirus (HERV) expression in
               tumours reflects epigenetic dysregulation of cancer and an
               oncogenic factor through promoter/enhancer action on genes.
               While more than 50\% of colorectal cancers develop liver
               metastases, HERV has not been studied in this context. METHODS:
               We collected 400 RNA-seq samples from over 200 patients with
               primary and liver metastases, including public data and a novel
               set of 200 samples. FINDINGS: We observed global stability of
               HERV expression between liver metastases and primary colorectal
               cancers, suggesting an early oncogenic footprint. We identified
               a list of 17 HERV loci for liver metastatic colorectal cancer
               (lmCRC) characterization; with tumour-specificity validated in
               single-cell metastatic colorectal cancer data and normal tissue
               bulk RNA-seq. Eleven loci produced HERV-derived peptides as per
               tandem mass spectrometry from primary colorectal cancer. Six
               loci were associated with the risk of relapse after lmCRC
               surgery. Four, HERVH\_Xp22.32a, HERVH\_20p11.23b,
               HERVH\_13q33.3, HERVH\_13q31.3, had adverse prognostic value
               (log-rank p-value 0.028, 0.0083, 9e-4, 0.05, respectively) while
               two, HERVH\_Xp22.2c (log-rank p-value 0.032) and HERVH\_8q21.3b
               (in multivariable models) were associated with better prognosis.
               Moreover, the markers showed a cumulative effect on survival
               when expressed. Some were associated with decreased cytotoxic
               immune cells and most of them correlated with cell cycle
               pathways. INTERPRETATION: These findings provide insights into
               the lmCRC transcriptome landscape by suggesting prognostic
               markers and potential therapeutic targets. FUNDING: This work

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Breast Cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer
               in women around the world and 70\% of cases are hormone-receptor
               positive (HR+). In 40\% of cases, a key mechanism of endocrine
               resistance to the standard first line is a mutation of the
               ligand-binding domain (LBD) of Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1)
               encoding estrogen receptor $\alpha$ (ER). Most common ESR1
               mutations that occur at positions 537 and 538 have been
               associated with poor clinical outcomes. ESR1 mutations have the
               potential to provide neoantigens. This study aims to identify if
               ESR1 mutations generate specific T cell responses against ESR1
               neoantigens in patients with HR+ HER2- BC, and to investigate if
               ESR1 mutations might correlate with a gene expression profile
               related to immune surveillance disruption. METHODS: We
               identified candidate ESR1-derived peptides by predictive
               software (SYFPEITHI and NetMHCpan 3.0). Then the immunogenicity
               of ESR1-derived peptides was assessed in
               Peripheral-Blood-Mononuclear-Cells from 31 healthy donors (HD)
               and 25 patients with metastatic HR-positive BC by IFN-$\gamma$
               ELISpot assay. A vaccination assay on a humanized mouse model
               (HLA-A2/DR1) was used to validate the immunogenicity and the
               presentation of these peptides. Finally, we used Bulk RNA-Seq
               sequencing along with MCPcounter, a cellular deconvolution
               method, to investigate the immune contexture of ESR1-mutated BC.
               RESULTS: Preliminary results showed recognition of ESR1-derived
               peptides by women HD lymphocytes but not in men. Frequencies and
               intensities of such immune responses were increased in patients
               with BC. Our results showed that 40\% of patients had specific
               immune responses. In addition, we demonstrated the HLA-A2 ESR1
               peptide immunogenicity in humanized HLA-A2/DR1 mice. In a data
               set generated from BC patients refractory to conventional
               therapy we showed that ESR1 mutations are correlated in advanced
               diseases with downregulation of molecules involved in antigen
               presentation and with loss HLA Class I gene expression.
               ESR1-mutated BC had a decrease in immune cell infiltration.
               CONCLUSION: These results support that common ESR1 mutations
               generate neoantigens in hormone-receptor positive metastatic
               breast cancers. If ESR1 peptides-restricted lymphocytes were
               detectable in BC patients, ESR1 mutations promote immune escape
               at advanced stages. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,

               for most treatments administered to patients. To bridge this
               gap, we analyze a pan-cancer cohort (META-PRISM) of 1,031
               refractory metastatic tumors profiled via whole-exome and
               transcriptome sequencing. META-PRISM tumors, particularly
               prostate, bladder, and pancreatic types, displayed the most
               transformed genomes compared with primary untreated tumors.
               Standard-of-care resistance biomarkers were identified only in
               lung and colon cancers-9.6\% of META-PRISM tumors, indicating
               that too few resistance mechanisms have received clinical
               validation. In contrast, we verified the enrichment of multiple
               investigational and hypothetical resistance mechanisms in
               treated compared with nontreated patients, thereby confirming
               their putative role in treatment resistance. Additionally, we

               (TILs) derived from colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases
               treated with chemotherapy and radical surgery. TILs from 43

               results for 28 CRC liver metastases pretreated with chemotherapy

               be an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.003), along with CD3
               density at invasion margins (p = 0.003) and TIGIT expression on
               CD4+ T cells (p = 0.019). CD155 was not associated with the

               of CD226 on CD8+ TILs in the liver microenvironment was restored

               PD-1 blockade can generate remarkable tumor responses. It is now
               well established that TGF-$beta$1 signaling is a major
               component of treatment resistance and contributes to the
               cancer-related immunosuppressive microenvironment. However,
               whether TGF-$beta$1 remains an obstacle to immune checkpoint
               inhibitor efficacy when immunotherapy is combined with
               chemotherapy is still to be determined. Several syngeneic murine
               models were used to investigate the role of TGF-$\beta$1
               neutralization on the combinations of immunogenic chemotherapy
               (FOLFOX: 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) and anti-PD-1.
               Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and immune cells were
               isolated from CT26 and PancOH7 tumor-bearing mice treated with
               FOLFOX, anti-PD-1 $\pm$ anti-TGF-$beta$1 for bulk and single
               cell RNA sequencing and characterization. We showed that
               TGF-$beta$1 neutralization promotes the therapeutic efficacy of
               FOLFOX and anti-PD-1 combination and induces the recruitment of
               antigen-specific CD8+ T cells into the tumor. TGF-$\beta$1
               neutralization is required in addition to chemo-immunotherapy to
               promote inflammatory CAF infiltration, a chemokine production
               switch in CAF leading to decreased CXCL14 and increased CXCL9/10
               production and subsequent antigen-specific T cell recruitment.
               The immune-suppressive effect of TGF-$beta$1 involves an
               epigenetic mechanism with chromatin remodeling of CXCL9 and
               CXCL10 promoters within CAF DNA in a G9a and EZH2-dependent
               fashion. Our results strengthen the role of TGF-$beta$1 in the
               organization of a tumor microenvironment enriched in
               myofibroblasts where chromatin remodeling prevents CXCL9/10
